# Define your own detector here, this can be loaded by the generator.
# Use the same prescriptions as for the input files (see README.md).
# You can specify numbers, variables, mathematical operations, strings (with single/double quotes) and lists (enclosed in square brackets).
# In the following you can read about the parameters you must specify:
#    name (str): name of the experiment (your are free to use capital letters, when needed)
#    fluxfile (str): path of the fluxes file with respect to this file directory or the system flux directory
#    flux_norm (float): flux normalization factor: ALL FLUXES ARE NORMALIZED SO THAT THE UNITS ARE nus/cm^2/GeV/POT
#    erange (list of float): neutrino energy range [<min>, <max>] in GeV
#    nuclear_targets (list of string): detector materials in the form of "<element_name><mass_number>" (e.g. "Ar40")
#    fiducial_mass_per_target (list of float): Fiducial mass for each target in order
#    POTs (float): protons on target
# in general you can specify any number of parameters, but only the one above would be relevant
